\maketitle
I found this dictionary in my closet a year ago. It was given to me by my mother
somewhere in the 2000s, and she in turn received it from her older brother in the 70s.
He was not the first owner.

The book has a brown cover that resembles leather, wearing off the corners and tearing apart
in the back. %mention the tissue behind the leather
